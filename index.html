                            <p>Hi there.</p>
                            <p> Welcome to my Portfolio, thank you for coming.</p>
                            <p> I am Gage and (at the time of making this) I'm 18 years old. I got started making websites in my senior year of High School because I got annoyed that they kept blocking all the good gaming sites, so I decided I would make my own.</p>
                            <p>When I started off I didn't know much, and the only class I had taken on website making was a Web Master class in which we learned how to make websites through the software Dreamweaver. Because I was trying to create a website on a chromebook which couldn't run Dreamweaver, this didn't help much. I went into the web and learned pretty basic html, css, and the smallest bit of javascript over the course of about 4 months. I wasn't great, and had no idea how to make a website responsive. </p>
                            <p>By then I had decided that I really enjoyed making websites, and that I might even enjoy pursuing a career in it. I went online to figure out a way that this might be possible. I found the coding bootcamp at University of Richmond and thought it sounded great. After a few months I was enrolled and ready to start.</p>
